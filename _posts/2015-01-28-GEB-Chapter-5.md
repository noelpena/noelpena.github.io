#Business Writing

Subject connected to purpose statement. Purpose governs whole documents. Then you have a preview, which connects you to the topics.

Topics is the support for the purpose. Supporting sentences support the topic sentences

**Preview**

- topic 2
- topic 3

**Topic 1** - which connects back to purpose and develops paragraph

- Supporting 1
- Supporting 2
- Supporting 3

**Topic 2** - which connects back to purpose and develops paragraph

- Supporting 1
- Supporting 2
- Supporting 3

**Topic 3** - which connects back to purpose and develops paragraph

**Conclusion**

**Weaver model**
- Purpose is message intended
- Conclusion is message executive

In between you have the source and the YOU, the interpreter 

The preview lets the reader into your mind. This is what you want to do as the encoder. Once the decoder understands the information they can do what you want them to do with it.

#Business letters
> Chapter 7 & 8

**2 kinds of business letters**

1. Routine business letter - CH7
2. negative business letter - CH8

##Purpose and goal of routine business letters

1. Stating your request
2. Replies to 
3. Positive messages (e.g. good news good will)

###Types of Routine business letters

1. Ask for information on action
2. Ask for recommendations
3. Making claims (complaints) and requesting adjustments

##Purpose and goal of negative business letters
Delivering negative information is rarely easy and never enjoyable, but with some helpful guidelines, you can craft messages that minimize negative reactions. When you need to de- liver bad news, you have five goals: 

1. to convey the bad news
2. to gain acceptance for it
	- Your're breaking bad new to them
3. to maintain as much goodwill as possible with your audience
4. to maintain a good image for your organization, 
5. if appropriate, to reduce or eliminate the need for fu- ture correspondence on the matter.
	- You don't want to keep it open or want them to come back with more questions.

###Types of Negative business letters
1. Sending Negative Messages on Routine Business Matters
	- Negative announcement
2. Sending Negative Employment Messages
	- You didn't get the job
3. Sending Negative Organizational News
	- Refusals to recommendations or requests
4. Responding to Negative Information for transactions

##There are 4 similarities between routine business and negative business letter - see page 170

- Both have company address
- Both have a date
- Both have customer address
- Both have an opening (intro), body, and conclusion (closing)
	- This is the structure of the paper

##Differences between routine business and negative business letter

**Routine business letters:**

- Uses direct approach (Message + Reasons)
- **Opening** assumes reader will comply
- **Body** gives specific details or information to explain purpose
- **Closing** is profession and courteous. Defines an action you want them to take. Has an expression of gratitude and has your contact information

**Negative business letters:**

- Indirect approach (Reasons, then the Message)
- **Opening** uses a buffer
	- A buffer is a neutral, noncontroversial statement that is closely related to the point of the message but doesn't convey the bad news. See table 8.2
- **Body** provides reasoning to justify the message/purpose or in this case, bad news
	- There's a strategy to this reasoning. You begin with the positive and move into the negative reasoning. 
	- Then it states the bad news
- **Closing** is respectful, meaningful (NO cliches), and you don't offer additional communication.

**Tips for giving bad news:**

1. Minimize space for bad news. Should be part of a paragraph
2. Use compound or compound-complex sentences for bad news
3. Embed it in a paragraph. You DON'T want it to be the first or last sentence in a paragraph.
4. If you can you want to offer a conditional. E.g. We can't credit you, but here's a coupon for this purchase
