<h3 id="persuasion">Persuasion</h3>

<p><strong>Persuasion</strong> - getting someone to change their beliefs, attitudes, and actions</p>

<p>Persuasion is based on compromise. Persuasion is an exchange, meaning there is a giving and receiving. </p>

<p>Persuasion because it involves compromise, increases the need for audience analysis. In an audience analysis we look for demographics and why they are there, background information, etc… but we also look at <strong>motivation</strong>.</p>

<p>Motivation is the added dimension to persuasive speech. See PG. 224 Table - Human needs to motivation.</p>

<p>To help your focus, you should consult and decide in your audience analysis:</p>

<ol>
<li>Why your audience is there?</li>
<li>What do they want or need <strong>that you have</strong>? <br>
<ul><li><strong>This will be your tool for focus</strong> </li></ul></li>
</ol>

<h4 id="whats-the-goal-of-the-persuasive-speech">What’s the Goal of the persuasive speech</h4>

<p>A positive response from the audience, which means that they changed focus. Your focus becomes their focus.</p>

<p>Through persuasion we can come to synoptic (sames eyes), which means same focus.</p>

<p>That style that we all have comes out in persuasive presentations through technique.</p>
