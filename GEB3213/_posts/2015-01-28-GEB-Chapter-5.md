#Business Writing

Subject connected to purpose statement. Purpose governs whole documents. Then you have a preview, which connects you to the topics.

Topics is the support for the purpose. Supporting sentences support the topic sentences

**Preview**

- topic 1
- topic 2
- topic 3

**Topic 1** - which connects back to purpose and develops paragraph

- Supporting 1
- Supporting 2
- Supporting 3

**Topic 2** - which connects back to purpose and develops paragraph

- Supporting 1
- Supporting 2
- Supporting 3

**Topic 3** - which connects back to purpose and develops paragraph

- Supporting 1
- Supporting 2
- Supporting 3

**Conclusion**

- restate purpose
- major points
- action for the reader. Action or direction


**Weaver model**
- Purpose is message intended
- Conclusion is message executive

In between you have the source and the YOU, the interpreter 

The preview lets the reader into your mind. This is what you want to do as the encoder. Once the decoder understands the information they can do what you want them to do with it.


#Completing

Most common skipped thing in writing is revision and it's one of the most important.

**Poor quality message** 

- create confusion, which creates extra communications which means more money
- Convey poor thinking
- increase frustration
- increase cost

Best things to do is to complete the work... walk away for a day and revise.

**Revision process takes 3 passes:**

1. (Pass 1) Evaluate content, organization, and tone
2. (Pass 2) Revising for readability
3. (Pass 3) Editing for clarity and conciseness
