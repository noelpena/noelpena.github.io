Process of Writing
===
A business report
---

Accuracy of information is so important because of key decisions and your creditability. We have to use reputable and credible resources.

###Step 1 in Writing is Planning your research

1. State and define our purpose and problem
	- Specific purpose: To analyze the critical for factors success and recommend the best location for HQâ€™s success.
2. What decision do you have to make?
3. What conclusions do have to reach?
	- Convince and persuade partners and directors

###Step 2  - Conduct your Research 

1. 10 Sources = 9 secondary & 1 primary (interview)
	- Secondary research is other research
	- Primary research is you're the author
2. Complete your research log
	- **Some APA sources say you don't cite primary research. Recommendation IS to cite primary research**
	- **Citation for Interview**	- Last Name, F. (Date of interview). Personal communication

###Step 3 - Process your research - your validity check
- Check credibility of sources
	1. Check Domain name
	2. Check for Bias
		- Is it a Journal or publication
		- Verify resources - who's on their reference list
		- Purpose of the writing (or check the purpose of the journal)
	3. How current is the publication or resources
		- Don't use anything over 10 years
	4. Does this article contradict what you've read in other articles?
- Code and categorize your research notes, quotes, examples and statistics in your research log

###Step 4 - Manage your data and apply your findings
1. Sort your categories based on codes
2. Determine which quotes examples and statistics you will use verbatim
3. Paraphrase - notes, quotes, examples (in your own words)
4. Summarize your findings for each category and how they apply to your purpose
	- Draw conclusions from your summary of findings. **Decision on factors, which will lead to recommendation on location.**

###Step 5  - To write the report
1. We use the direct approach, meaning state what it's about, then the recommendation
2. Recommendation Report
	1. Detail your research
		- The benefits
		- The challenges
			- How to address them
		- **Introduction** - Explains your research process and flow
			- 3rd and 4th paragraph talk about research methology how she came up with research
			- Reader need to understand research process


####Factors Considered - This is UNBIASED (opinions are not present on this part of the body)

- Factors - How it is designed for the business and report
- Findings - What's important for the board to know about the factors
- Benefits - to each location
- Risk cost - to each location
- Summary - What are the important things about this section you want me to remember?

####Recommendation - . Body Pt2
1. State your recommendation cleary
2. Present the research persuasively
3. State the major challenge to your recommendation and how to handle it

####Outline
1. Introduction
	- States the purpose of the report - **Paragraph 1**
	- Context - What's the business about? - **Paragraph 2**
	- Research methodology on secondary and primary sources. **Paragraph 3 (and 4)**
		- Explain how you came up with the critical success factors of your business
	- State your recommendation briefly, based on research. **Paragraph 4 or 5**
	- Give preview to the sections of the paper and it's contents. **Paragraph 4 or 5**

2. Restate the recommendation
3. Summarize reasons for recommendation
	- Benefits
	- Risks
4. Action Requested - Simply when you would like a decision by
5. Expression of Gratitude; offer of additional assistance

###Developing your tables and graphs

####Table
- For APA the title of the table is to the left or right or above the table
- Tables must be numbered **EX** Table 1
	- Underneath "Table 1" Goes the name or description of the table.
- The table title or name of the table NEVER goes under the table. Improper format for APA.

Figure = Table

####Graph

- If you use the word Graph rather than table. The graph title and name always goes BELOW the graph in APA.

***If you have a graph or table you have to explain it. What points do you want the reader to get out of it***

Ex: As table 1 shows....
Ex: As you can see from Table 1

###Other Notes
- **Major headings** are in all CAPS and bold
- **Secondary headings** are left justified. First letter is capitalized and underlined
- **Subsidiary headings** are indented and underlined


**Only do 3 or 4 factors**
