###Shannon-Weaver Model of Communication

**Model to be used this semester**

![Shannon-Weaver Model](http://communicationtheory.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/shannon_weaver_model.jpg)

The intent of using this model is to **find the intent of the message** and to **be sure the message is executed**.

#Second Class: Relationship

All business communication has to be
1. Effective
2. Efficient

**TIME IS MONEY**

Starting point of process (planning) is audience analysis. **The audience is the decoder**

##The Rhetorical Triangle
![The Rhetorical Triangle](http://sites.stedwards.edu/socialmedia-mbrowde/files/2013/02/Rhetorical-Triangle-1w8kd9e.jpg)

Built on a relationship of 3's

###Pathos

> **How your audience receives your message**

- Planning
- Audience Analysis
- Emotion

<br>

	Direct Method - Positive Approach
	Indirect Method - Evidence first then decision

###Ethos

**Is how you establish credibility, so that the receiver gets the message accurately, timely, understandably, and reliably.**

- Is you
- Tone
	- Pg. 83 gives hints on establishing credibility
		- Language
		- Inflection
	- Always better positive
- Using Professional Language
	1. Mean what you say & Say what you mean
	2. Don't write to impress, write to express
	3. Ethics
		- Honest
		- Objective
		- Transparent

<br>

	INCREASE UNDERSTANDING
	DECREASE UNCERTAINTY


##Logos = Word

###Decide
Direct VS Indirect

###Word Choice
**Words that you & your audience understand**

- **Precise** - Specific expression of what you want to say
	1. **Clarity**
	2. **Avoid using** unnecessary adverbs & adjectives 
- Business talk
- Jargon
	- Avoid buzzwords and cliches

**Pg.85 gives good example of conversational style language**

Only use jargon with specific audiences. If you use jargon the first time...explain it. Avoid using *abstract language* <br> **(this is still under word choice)**

**Abstract Language:** If you use abstract language you have to **qualify** or **quantify it**.

General broad meaning leads to imprecise meaning. Try to focus on concepts, qualities, and characteristics. Use tangible language: Language that is concrete and measurable. Try [www.visuwords.com](http://www.visuwords.com).

###Tense (Still under Logos)
**Active voice VS passive voice. An active voice is preferred**

####Active Voice

	Subject peforms the Action
	Ex: You *wrote* the paper

Active voice is **stronger** and **clearer**

####Passive Voice

	Subject receives the action
	Ex: The paper *was written* by you.

Passive voice includes **more words** and **more confusion**. The passive voice is used with bad news, similar to indirect approach. A passive voice will also be used when you don't want to accept the blame. Passive voice creates more objectivity.

###Sentence Construction

A sentence = **subject** + **Verb** (independent Clause)

**An independent clause is a complete thought.**

	Independent Clause preceding Dependent Clause (no comma)
	Ex: You wrote the paper when I told you to do it.

	Dependent Clause preceding Independent Clause (comma used)
	Ex: When I told you to do it, you wrote the paper.

	Dependent clauses usually start with a preposition

	Independent Clause, + Independent Clause  = Comma before Conjunction
	Conjuntions: and, or, but
	You don't need a comma. You can use a semicolon and no conjunction

	Phrase should be linked with semicolons


TCC.FL.EDU --> Grammar diagnostics

**There are 4 kinds of sentences:**

1. Simply
2. Compound (2 IC linked by conjunction)
3. Complex (DC & IC)
4. Compound-complex (Multiple DC's & IC's)

**Effective business writing has a balance of sentence types**

- **Short sentences:** 15 Words or less
- **Medium Sentences:** 16-25 words
	- Compound and Complex sentences
	- Good for relationships & clarity
- **Large sentences:** 26+ words
	- To convey complex ideas
	- list a number of points
	- summarize information

###Paragraph Construction (still under Logos)

A **Paragraph** is a collection of terms and sentences that convey a single idea or topic in a logical manner.

The formula for a paragraph is a **Topic Sentence**, **Supporting Sentence**, and **Transition**. 

####Topic Sentence
Try to convince the reader that the topic sentence is true.

####Supporting Sentences
The supporting sentence has to relate to the topic sentence by justifying, explaining or extend the topic sentence through example.

####Transitions

**There are 2 types of transitions**

1. Inter-paragraph. See Pg. 35 for examples
2. Intra-paragraph. Words, phrases, sentences, paragraph

**Summary- Intro method**<br>
Sentence that summarizes previous point and introduces new point

**There are 5 purposes for paragraphs**

1. To illustrate
2. to compare or contrast
3. demonstrate cause & effect
4. to categorize
5. to provide problem resolution
