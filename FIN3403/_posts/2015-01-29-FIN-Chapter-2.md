##Chapter 1 and 2 Homework

*Problem 2-1 Building a Balance Sheet [LO1]*<br>
**Penguin Pucks, Inc., has current assets of $4,800, net fixed assets of $27,500, current liabilities of $4,200, and long-term debt of $10,500.**

> **What is the value of the shareholders’ equity account for this firm?**


| Balance Sheet | | | | |
| :------- | ----: | | | :----: |
| Current Assets	| $4,800	| | Current Liabilities		| $4,200 |
| Net Fixed Assets	| $27,500	| | Long-term Debt		| $10,500 |
| Total Assets		| $32,300	| | **Owner's Equity**		|?|
| 			| 		| | Total Liabilities & Equity	| $32,300 |

Because our balance sheet must balance **Total Liabilities & Equity** will equal $32,300 in **Total Assets**

So, Owner Equity is the difference between Total Liabilities & Equity ($32,300) and Long-term debt + Current Liabilities (4,200 + 10,500).

    Total Liabilities & Equity - (Long-term debt + Current Liabilities) = Owner's Equity
    --> 32300 - (4,200 + 10,500) = 17,600


> **How much is net working capital?**

    Net Working Capital = Current Assets - Current Liabilities
    --> 600 = 4800 - 4200


*Problem 2-2 Building an Income Statement [LO1]*<br>
**Billy’s Exterminators, Inc., has sales of $734,000, costs of $315,000, depreciation expense of $48,000, interest expense of $35,000, and a tax rate of 35 percent.**

> **What is the net income for this firm?**

| Income Statement | | |
| :------- | :---: | 
| Sales		| $734,000 	|
| Cost		| $315,000	|
| Depreciation	| $48,000	|
| EBIT		| ?		|
| Interest	| $35,000	|
| EBT		| ?		|
| Taxes	(35%)	| $123,200 	|
| **Net Income**| ? 		|


> *EBT = (Earning Before Taxes or Taxable Income)*
> *EBIT = (Earning Before Interest and Taxes)*

    Sales - (Cost and Depreciation) = EBIT
    EBIT - Interest = EBT
    EBT - Taxes = Net Income
    
    734,000 - (315,000 + 48,000) = 371,000
    371,000 - 35,000 = 336,000
    --> 336,000 - 117,600 = 218,400
    

*Problem 2-3 Dividends and Retained Earnings [LO1]*<br>
**Billy’s Exterminators, Inc., has sales of $734,000, costs of $315,000, depreciation expense of $48,000, interest expense of $35,000, a tax rate of 35 percent and paid out $85,000 in cash dividends.**

> **What is the addition to retained earnings?**

| Income Statement | | |
| :------- | ---: | 
| Sales		| $734,000 	|
| Cost		| $315,000	|
| Depreciation	| $48,000	|
| EBIT		| $371,000	|
| Interest	| $35,000	|
| EBT		| $336,000	|
| Taxes	(35%)	| $123,200 	|
| Net Income 	| $218,400	|
| Less Dividends| $85,000 	|
| **Addition to Retained Earnings**	| ? |

Find **Net Income**, then subtract **Dividends** to get **Addition to Retained Earnings**

    Net Income - Dividends = Addition to Retained Earnings
    --> 218,400 - 85,000 = $133,400


*Problem 2-4 Per-Share Earnings and Dividends [LO1]*<br>
**Billy’s Exterminators, Inc., has sales of $734,000, costs of $315,000, depreciation expense of $48,000, interest expense of $35,000, a tax rate of 35 percent and paid out $85,000 in cash dividends. The common stock outstanding is 110,000 shares.**

> **What is the earnings per share**?

| Income Statement | | |
| :------- | ---: | 
| Sales			| $734,000 	|
| Cost			| $315,000	|
| Depreciation		| $48,000	|
| EBIT			| $371,000	|
| Interest		| $35,000	|
| EBT			| $336,000	|
| Taxes	(35%)		| $123,200 	|
| Net Income 		| $218,400	|
| | |
| Less Dividends	| $85,000 	|
| Shares of Common Stock| $110,000 	|
| | |
| **Earnings Per Share** 	| ? |
| **Dividends Per Share** 	| ? |


    Net Income / Shares of Common Stock = Earnings Per Share
    --> 218,400 / 110,000 = 1.99 (1.9854)

> **What is the dividends per share?**

    Dividends / Shares of Common Stock = Dividends Per Share
    --> 85,000 / 110,000 = 0.77 (0.7727)


*Problem 2-5 Market Values and Book Values [LO1]*<br>
**Klingon Widgets, Inc., purchased new cloaking machinery three years ago for $6 million. The machinery can be sold to the Romulans today for $5.3 million. Klingon’s current balance sheet shows net fixed assets of $3.2 million, current liabilities of $900,000, and net working capital of $215,000. If all the current assets were liquidated today, the company would receive $1.25 million cash.**

> **What is the book value of Klingon’s total assets today?**

You are given **Net Fixed Assets**, which equals all fixed assets (Land, buildings, equipment, machinery, vehicles) less **accumulated Depreciation**.

    Net Fixed Assets = $3,200,000

You are given **Current Liabilities** and **Net Working Capital**. You need to find **Current Assets**

    Current Assets - Current Liabilities = Net Working Capital
    ? - 900,000 = 215,000
    Current Assets = $1,115,000

Given **Net Fixed Assets** and **Current Assets** you can find **Total Assets**

    Total Assets = Net Fixed Assets + Total Current Assets
    ? = 3,200,000 - 1,115,000
    --> Total Assets = 4,315,000

This is the **book value of total assets** because these numbers are based of the books or the balance sheet.

> **What is the market value?**

The **market value** is found by looking at how much the assets are sold for.

    Current Assets sold for $1.25 Million
    Machinery sold for $5.3 Million

    1.25 + 5.3 = 6.55 (6,550,000 Million)


*Problem 2-6 Calculating Taxes [LO3]*<br>
**The Anberlin Co. had $255,000 in 2011 taxable income.  Use the tax rates from Table 2.3.**

> **Calculate the company’s 2011 income taxes.**

$50,000 x 0.15 = $7,500
$25,000 x 0.25 = $6,250
$25,000 x 0.34 = $8,500
($255,000 - 100,000) x 0.39 = $60,450

![enter image description here](http://lectures.mhhe.com/connect/0077479475/Table%202.3.JPG)

    --> 7500 + 6250 + 8500 + 60450 = 82,700

*Problem 2-7 Tax Rates [LO3]*<br>
**The Anberlin Co. had $255,000 in 2011 taxable income. Use the tax rates from Table 2.3.**

> **What is the average tax rate?**

    Average tax rate = Total Taxes / Taxable Income
    --> 32.43% = 82700 / 255000


> **What is the marginal tax rate?**

    Marginal tax rate = Total Taxes / Taxable Income
    --> 39%


*Problem 2-8 Calculating OCF [LO4]*<br>
**Chevelle, Inc., has sales of $39,500, costs of $18,400, depreciation expense of $1,900, and interest expense of $1,400.**

> **If the tax rate is 35 percent, what is the operating cash flow?**

| Income Statement | | |
| :------- | ---: | 
| Sales			| $39,500 	|
| Cost			| $18,400	|
| Depreciation		| $1,900	|
| EBIT			| $19,200	|
| Interest		| $1,400	|
| EBT			| $17,800	|
| Taxes	(35%)		| $6,230 	|
| Net Income 		| $11,570	|
| | |
| EBIT 			| $19,200	|
| Add Back depreciation | $1,900	|
| Less Taxes		| ($6,230) 	|
| | |
| **Operating Cash Flow** 	| ? |

    Operating cash flow is EBIT + depreciation - taxes
    --> (19200 + 1900) - 6230 = 14,870


*Problem 2-14 Calculating Total Cash Flows [LO4]*<br>
**Jetson Spacecraft Corp. shows the following information on its 2011 income statement: sales = $235,000; costs = $141,000; other expenses = $7,900; depreciation expense = $17,300; interest expense = $12,900; taxes = $19,565; dividends = $12,300. In addition, you’re told that the firm issued $6,100 in new equity during 2011 and redeemed $4,500 in outstanding long-term debt.**

> **What is the 2011 operating cash flow?**

| Income Statement | | |
| :------- | ---: | 
| Sales			| $235,000 	|
| Cost			| $141,000	|
| Other Expenses	| $7,900	|
| Depreciation		| $17,300	|
| EBIT			| $68,800	|
| Interest		| $12,900	|
| EBT			| $55,900	|
| Taxes			| $19,565 	|
| Net Income 		| $36,335	|
| | |
| Dividends		| $12,300	|
| Issued Stock equity 	| $6,100 	|
| **Operating Cash Flow** 	| ? | 	

    Operating cash flow is EBIT + depreciation - taxes
    --> (68800 + 17300) - 19565 = 66535

> **What is the 2011 cash flow to stockholders?**

"redeemed $4,500 in outstanding long-term debt" - This means that they got this amount back, so it's added because when you subtract a negative number.

    Interest - Net New borrowing = cash flow to stockholders
    12900 - (4500) = 17,400


> **What is the 2011 cash flow to creditors?**

    Dividends paid - New Equity = cash flow to creditors
    12300 - 6100 = 6200

> **If net fixed assets increased by $25,000 during the year, what was the addition to NWC?**

Sales - Cost - Other Expenses - Interest - Taxes - Dividends + New Equity - Redeemed outstanding long-term debt - (depreciation + increase in net fixed assets)

    --> 635


*Problem 2-15 Using Income Statements [LO1]*<br>
**You are given the following information for Calvani Pizza Co.: sales = $52,000; costs = $27,300; addition to retained earnings = $5,300; dividends paid = $1,800; interest expense = $4,900; tax rate = 35 percent. **

> **Calculate the depreciation expense.**
