##Question #1

###SDJ, Inc., has net working capital of $2,710, current liabilities of $3,950, and inventory of $3,420.
  
####What is the current ratio? (Round your answer to 2 decimal places. (e.g., 32.16))

#####Current Ratio
	Net Working Capital = Current Assets - Current Liabilities
	2710 = x - 3950
	x = 6660
	Current Ratio = Current Assets / Current liabilities
	? = 6660 / 3950
	--> 1.69

#####Quick Ratio
	Quick Ratio = (Current Assets - Inventory) / Current liabilities
	? = (6660 - 3420) / 3950
	--> 0.82


##Question #2

###Perry, Inc., has a total debt ratio of 0.46. 

####What is its debt–equity ratio? (Round your answer to 2 decimal places. (e.g., 32.16))

#####Debt–equity ratio
	Total Assets - Total Debt Ratio = Total Equity
	1 - 0.46 = Total Equity
	Total Equity = 0.54

	Debt–equity ratio = Total debt/Total equity
	? = 0.46 / 0.54
	--> 


####What is its equity multiplier? (Round your answer to 2 decimal places. (e.g., 32.16))

#####Equity multiplier
	Equity multiplier = Total assets / Total equity
	? = 1 / 0.54
	--> 1.85

	Equity multiplier = Total Assets / Total Equity
	 = 1 + Debt–equity ratio
	 = (Total equity + Total debt) / Total equity

##Question #3

That Wich Corp. had additions to retained earnings for the year just ended of $375,000. The firm paid out $175,000 in cash dividends, and it has ending total equity of $4.8 million. The company currently has 145,000 shares of common stock outstanding.
  

What are earnings per share? (Do not round intermediate calculations and round your final answer to 2 decimal places. (e.g., 32.16))
   
  Earnings 	$ per share  
  
What are dividends per share? (Round your answer to 2 decimal places. (e.g., 32.16))
  
  Dividends 	$ per share  
  
What is the book value per share? (Round your answer to 2 decimal places. (e.g., 32.16))
  
  Book value 	$ per share  
  

If the stock currently sells for $79 per share, what is the market-to-book ratio? (Do not round intermediate calculations and round your final answer to 2 decimal places. (e.g., 32.16))
  
  Market-to-book ratio 	times  
  

What is the price–earnings ratio? (Do not round intermediate calculations and round your final answer to 2 decimal places. (e.g., 32.16))
  
  Price–earnings ratio 	times  
  

If the company had sales of $4.7 million, what is the price–sales ratio? (Do not round intermediate calculations and round your final answer to 2 decimal places. (e.g., 32.16))
  
  Price–sales ratio 	times  

##Question #4

###If Roten Rooters, Inc., has an equity multiplier of 1.45, total asset turnover of 1.80, and a profit margin of 5.5 percent.

####What is its ROE? (Round your answer to 2 decimal places. (e.g., 32.16))

#####Return On Equity
	ROE = Profit Margin x Total Asset Turnover X Equity Multiplier
	 = 1.45 x 1.80 x 5.5
	--> 14.36

##Question #5

###Kindle Fire Prevention Corp. has a profit margin of 4.6 percent, total asset turnover of 2.3, and ROE of 19.14 percent. 

####What is this firm’s debt–equity ratio? (Do not round intermediate calculations and round your final answer to 2 decimal places.(e.g., 32.16))

#####Debt-Equity Ratio
	ROE = Profit Margin x Total Asset Turnover X Equity Multiplier
	19.14 = 4.6 x 2.3 x ?
	19.14 = 10.58 x ?
	(19.14 / 10.58) = ?
	1.81 = ?
	Equity Multiplier = 1.81
	Equity Multiplier = 1 + Debt–equity ratio

	Equity Multiplier - 1 = Debt–equity ratio
	1.81 - 1 = Debt–equity ratio
	--> 0.81

	NOTE: ROE = ROA × Equity multiplier = ROA × (1 + Debt–equity ratio)

	
##Question #9

###First City Bank pays 7 percent simple interest on its savings account balances, whereas Second City Bank pays 7 percent interest compounded annually. 

####If you made a $64,000 deposit in each bank, how much more money would you earn from your Second City Bank account at the end of 9 years? (Do not round intermediate calculations and round your final answer to 2 decimal places. (e.g., 32.16))

#####Difference in accounts
	> Compounded <
	= P (1 + r)^t
	= 64000 (1 + .07)^9
	= $117,661.3896

	> Simple <
	64000 x 1.07 = 68480
	68480 - 64000 = 4480
	4480 x 9 = 40320
	--> 40320 + 64000 = 104,320
